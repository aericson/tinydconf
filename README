Module supposed to work as a wrapper for dconf.
For the moment only implements read/list
but should in the future implement all the 
functionality provided by the dconf binary,
by that I mean the following:

% dconf help

Usage:
  dconf COMMAND [ARGS...]

Commands:
  help              Show this information
  read              Read the value of a key
  list              List the contents of a dir
  write             Change the value of a key
  reset             Reset the value of a key or dir
  update            Update the system databases
  watch             Watch a path for changes

Use 'dconf help COMMAND' to get detailed help.

Does require however dconf installed, of course, and
it's headers.
